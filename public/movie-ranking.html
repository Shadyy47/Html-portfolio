<h2>My top 3 series movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3>
<p>This is my favourite series of all time.It is fantasy of its own world. It takes you to a new dimension that you have never been.</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>This is a sitcom which gets me everytime. And it keeps getting better as you watch it again and again.</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>This was a tough choice because there were a lot of movies that competing for the spot but this has to because of the phenomenal acting.</p>
